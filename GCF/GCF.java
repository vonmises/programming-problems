// Using java, have the function divide(num1,num2)
// take both parameters being passed and return the Greatest Common Factor.
// That is, return the greatest number that evenly goes into both numbers with no remainder.
// For example: 20 and 10 both are divisible by 1, 2, 5 and 10 so the output should be 10.
// The range for both parameters will be from 1 to 10^3.
