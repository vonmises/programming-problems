# Using the Python, have the function CaesarCipher(str,num) take the str parameter and perform a Caesar Cipher shift
# on it using the num parameter as the shifting number.
# A Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the
# string N places down in the alphabet (in this case N will be num).
# Punctuation, spaces, and capitalization should remain intact.
# For example if the string is "Caesar Cipher" and num is 2 the output should be "Ecguct Ekrjgt".
